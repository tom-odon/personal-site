In an effort to put more thoughts down on paper and build a professional brand, I decided to re-vamp my personal site with more of a blog format. I chose to use Jekyll, a Ruby static-site generator, because:

* I'm lazy, and while I want more control than a WordPress site, I don't want to think _too_ hard.
* I wanted to put my work into source control
* It's Ruby, and that's something different to me

I decided on the theme "people, process, tools" because in the past couple of years, problems I've encountered seemed to categorize into one of those three buckets. I've had opportunities to work with interesting, wonderful people in a variety of settings and seen seasons of harmony and collaboration as well as dissonance and friction. I've seen where processes empower folks and where they become detrimental to success. And I've worked with a good number of technologies- some I'm a fan of, some I didn't apply myself to enough to understand, some were annoying. Missing are methodologies, concepts, principles. Those have a place, sometimes in those buckets, and sometimes not. I'll probably write about them from time to time, but at least for now, I'll try to focus on those three buckets.

A quick search reveals that "people, process, tools" is apparently a [framework][PPT-Framework] that has existed since the 1960's, which would explain why a former CTO I worked with seemed to use the phrase frequently. I think the framework, while perhaps over-simplified, still has weight and relevance today. 

I'm excited to write more. Thanks for reading.
