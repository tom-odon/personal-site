## Hi, I'm Tom.

I'm a software engineer, technical leader, husband, and dad based in the Chicago area.

Software isn't just code. It's the product of people, processes, and tools that combine together to solve problems. This site is intended to be a record of my thoughts, interactions, and lessons learned with regard to those elements. I might write about unrelated topics occasionally. 

## Things I believe:

* That what you value says a lot about you as an engineer and a leader.
* That there's no right or prescribed way to go about many things in our industry - but there are ones that are more appopriate given a context.
* That we're never done learning. 

## Things I like:

When I'm not working, I'm likely reading with my kids, scrolling through Twitter, exercising, playing soccer, or attempting to fix something around my house. I drink my coffee black.
